Are you tired of manually importing VRCSDK, CyanEmu, VRWorldToolkit, UdonSharp, UdonToolkit or any other package into your new project or updating them over time?

Would you like to have direct access to an extensive list of information related to VRChat world creation right within your editor?

WorldCreatorAssistant is made to be the first package to be imported into your Unity projects and it takes care of the most common steps with the help of Project Setup Wizard that allows you to choose your preferred options for initializing the project.

WCA also has built-in resources and FAQ that are there for you when you need them the most.

> ### **DISCLAIMER:** *World Creator Assistant is still in Open Alpha and undocumented bugs may appear.*
